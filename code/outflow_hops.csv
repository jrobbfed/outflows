#Hunting for outflows in the 12CO CARMA Orion Data. 
#In the following table, I will go through all HOPS protostars covered by the 
#CARMA-NRO Orion footprint.
#If there are signs of an outflow IN 12CO, I will find the optimal blue and red velocity
#ranges to display it, these are written in blue_vel and red_vel (in km/s). If
#these values have '0' or '-' that means that the automatic fit value is fine. 
#If the outflow is seen in Tanabe's NRO-only study, tanabe = the outflow number #corresponding to tanabe's study. ? means unclear

In particular, to the SE there appears to be a bipolar red/blue outflow without any candidate source in either HOPS or Spitzer Orion.

However, HH 33/40 could be a separate flow (DFS 116) powered by a source which is not in HOPS or Spitzer Orion, IRS 116 by Davis et al. In IR, the H2 flow counterpart is SMZ 55, shown in Davis et al. Figure 7. In CO, I see very little evidence for an outflow. Chernin and Masson 1995 argue for the presence of a weak CO 2-1 outflow, mostly in the red lobe, with CSO observations. But if I use the same integration ranges, I don't see any significant CO emission."

191, 0, 7, 11, 29, "Protostar embedded in the head of a dust pillar in the VISTA image. SMZ 45 is a series of H2 knots extending S of the source, although Stanke et al. 2002 note that this is uncertain, they may be driven by the giant N-S L1641-N outflow to the south. Tanabe identifies the CO outflow 29 here. The 12CO spectrum shows a blue peak offset from the main peak at ~6 km/s. There may be a small blue CO lobe from 6-7.5 km/s in the S overlapping the H2 knots, or potentially a redshifted structure 3 arcminutes to the S but at velocities of ~11-13 km/s. No evidence however for any counterflow to the North. Tanabe's Outflow 29 includes both blue and redshiftend contours to the South of the source, this identification is dubious."
192, ?, 7.5, 10, -, "Several linear CO features in this area, which could be outflows driven by protostars HOPs 192 or 193. Zooming out, there is a linear redshifted feature at very large velocites (up to 17 km/s) located about 3 arcminutes to the SW but pointing back to these sources. At lower velocites down to ~ 10 km/s, this linear feature approaches the protostars, curving moderately. In the blue velocities, there is a linear feature about an arcminute to the W. Zooming in, this HOPS protostar has tiny blue/red contours oriented EW which perhaps make a tiny bipolar outflow, but I'm not sure how significant these contours are. This source also has a small NIR nebulosity in the VISTA image."
193, 0, 6.5, 10, -, "The large scale linear CO features are described in HOPS 192, the previous entry. There is no evidence for a small scale bipolar outflow here as in HOPS 192. This source is more embedded in the NIR image, with no nebulosity associated with it."
194, 0, 5.7, 10.7, 28, "This source, HOPS 194, is a flare star V* V1296 Ori. SMZ 43 is the H2 outflow identified here, Davis et al. notes its arc-like appearance and that it may be a PDR instead of an outflow. Tanabe identifies Outflow 28 with two compact blueshifted CO contours, but the geometry is not convincing. Maybe a pole-on outflow? "
198, ?, 5, 10, -, "SMZ 42, jet with bow shock at end, roughly 4 arcminutes NE-SW with HOPS 195 at its center. No clear CO outflow here. There is a distant (4 arcminute) very linear redshifted feature to the NE, pointing roughly back to HOPS 195. Also, there is a linear CO feature that shows up between 9 and 10 km/s, which is in the velocity range of the surrounding cloud. Perhaps this is an outflow lobe in the plane of the sky? This 9-10km/s feature is spatially correlated quite well with the extent of the H2 jet/bow shock!"
# 199, 0, -, -, -, "This source is located just off the edge of the CO map, and the elevated noise at the edge of the CO make any outflow determination impossible to be confident in."
# 200, 0, -, -, -, "4 arcminutes to the NE, there is a bow-shock seen in the H2 and NIR VISTA image. This is dubbed SMZ 40, and Davis et al. hypothesize that it is driven by this source, HOPS 200. The propermotion measurements in this bow-shock are very inconclusive on this point. This assocation is quite tentative. In CO, there's no evidence of an outflow here."
203, 1, 5.2, 11.7, 42, "This is the driving source of HH 1/2. SMZ 64 is the HH 1/2 outflow in H2. It's difficult to assing outflow contours here with all the overlapping emission. Also, note the vast redshfited lobe from HH 1/2 to the south, which is assigned by Tanabe to a different protostar in the south."
355, ?, 4.3, 10.5, -, "To the E and W is the beautiful parsec-long bipolar H2 flow identified by Davis et al. as DFS 123. Exquisite in VISTA image! This is likely the protostellar source of this H2 outflow, which is a new discovery! Because the source is very very red/embedded, it's basically undectable in the NIR image. Class 0 in HOPS. In CO, there is red and blue emission on either side of the source roughly on the same EW axis as the H2 flow, but its hard to make sense of the CO here in terms of a bipolar outflow. Could be this source is just too young?"
368, 1, 7, 14, 14, "In complex of outflows 13/14/15 from Tanabe. Zooming in, there is a pretty nice small N-S red/blue outflow driven by this source. I believe this one. The CARMA-NRO combined data reveals this one in much better detail than Tanabe's NRO-only observations. This CO outflow is cataloged in Takahashi et al. 2008 and Shimajiri et al. 2008 as well." 
369, 0, 7, 14, -, "This source in also in the outflow complex 13/14/15 in the OMC 2 region. Not assigned any outflows by Tanabe, but it could contribute to the linear redshifted lobe in the south, and perhaps some of the blueshifted emission to its north. Not a certain outflow but can't rule one out either." 
370, ?, 5, 17, 13, "So many red/blue contours in this location. The cluster of protostars could all be driving outflows, so it's hard to see how Tanabe made a confident identification of this protostar with this outflow. It looks like, perhaps the red/blue lobes to the NE of this source are driven by this source, whereas the blue/red contours to the SW may be a new bipolar outflow driven by Spitzer Orion 2293 (IRS 17/MMS 17)"
371, 0, 5.5, 11.5, -, "This protostar is in the vicinity of the giant blue outflow lobe of Tanabe 25/SMZ 38. But no CO outflow is apparent from this source."
378, 0, 5, 11, -, "This Class I protostar is located right in the middle of the HH 2 bow shock / H2 knots. But it appears unrelated to this outflow. There is a lot of redshifted CO here which could be entirely part of the HH 2 flow, or partly driven by a separate outflow coming from this source. No blueshifted CO is apparent."

380, 0, 4, 12, -, "HOPS 380 is the 3rd protostar in the group with HOPS 173/174 which may be responsible for Tanabe outflow 36 and H2 flow DFS115. See the entries for HOPS 173/174 for more."
# 382, 0, -, -, -, "No evidence for CO outflow around this run of the mill Class I source."
383, 1, -, -, -, "This source has red/blue lobes on either side in CO, but the blue lobe to the SE is assigned by Tanabe to their Outflow 2 w/ the disk source Spitzer Orion 2450 as the driving source. The morphology of the CO definitely points to HOPS 383 as the more likely source of the blue lobe and perhaps some portion of the red emission to the NW, part of which is in Outflow 1. Stanke et al. 2002 do not assign a driving source to the H2 flow SMZ 2, which consists of 2 H2 knots and an arc of diffuse emission near to the disk source to the south. I believe it's more likely this H2 flow as well as the CO outflow are driven by HOPS 383."
394, 0, 8, 14, -, "HOPS 394 is a Class 0 protostar in a region with several outflows (Tanabe 9-12). This source could potentially drive the redshifted CO just to the North, but it seems more likely that is part of the bipolar outflow/H2 outflow driven by HOPS 70 (SMZ 15)."
409, 0, 8, 14.5, -, "Outflow 18 from Tanabe gives the redshifted emission on top of this source to the Spitzer Orion 2236 (classified as Protostar) just to the SW. But HOPS 409 could just as well be driving any of the redshifted emission in this area. Or, perhaps more likely, there is no outflow here and the redshifted emission is just an extension of the cloud."

# Miscellaneous Notes
# ---------------------
# Need to also check all Davis flows that are not driven by a HOPS source. (either the source is unidentified in Davis or it is identified but not in the HOPS catalog.

# Spitzer Orion 747 drive H2 flow DFS 124, or this may be part of the large southern lobe of HH 1/2. THe large amount of blue/red CO in this area is assigned to the new Outflow 43 by Tanabe.

# Tanabe outflow 18 (not listed above but described in HOPS 409 entry) is assigned to Spitzer Orion protostar 2236 (without H2), I doubt this outflow, seems to be part of the M43 bubble.
# Tanabe outflow 9 (not listed above) is driven not by a HOPS source, but a Spitzer Orion disk source with H2 jet from Davis.
# Tanabe outflow 2 (not listed above) is driven not by a HOPS source, but a Spitzer Orion disk source with H2 jet from Davis.

# Spitzer Orion 2368 - possible source of red lobe of Tanabe Outflow 7.
# Spitzer Orion 2293 - possible source of a small red/blue outflow separate from the nearby Outflow 13 of tanabe, this could also be related to HOPS108. NEW CO outflow here!

# V380 Ori (Spitzer Orion 796) may be source of red "cauliflower" emission attributed by Tanabe to Outflow 40/SMZ 63 - from HOPS 166 to the South.

# V563 Ori seems to be the driving source of the CO 'fan' sticking out the north side of the very northern edge of the cloud into NGC1977. You can see a U-shaped dark feature in the VISTA NIR image.


# hops93 and 94 seem to have small outflows (based on IR nebulosity) look for corresponding CO. 
# hop91 might have outflow extending SErede) to NW (blue)
