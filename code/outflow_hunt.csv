#Hunting for outflows in the 12CO CARMA Orion Data. 
#In the following table, I will go through all HOPS protostars covered by the 
#CARMA-NRO Orion footprint.
#If there are signs of an outflow IN 12CO, I will find the optimal blue and red velocity
#ranges to display it, these are written in blue_vel and red_vel (in km/s). If
#these values have '0' or '-' that means that the automatic fit value is fine. 
#If the outflow is seen in Tanabe's NRO-only study, tanabe = the outflow number #corresponding to tanabe's study. ? means unclear

In particular, to the SE there appears to be a bipolar red/blue outflow without any candidate source in either HOPS or Spitzer Orion.

#Hunting for outflows around all H2 flows/jets catalogued in Davis et al. 2009 without HOPS sources. There are a total of 46 Davis H2 flows without corresponding HOPS sources. These either have no source identified in Davis, and thus the location is the position of the most prominent H2 feature (29 of these). Or they have a source identified but the source is not in the HOPS catalog (17 of these)

This source is located just between two red/blue local maxima of CO emission, which looks like it could be a new very small scale outflow. Both red/blue emission extends to the spectral extrema of the cube. To better see the distinction of this CO outflow from the larger one to the NE, it helps to use very extreme velocity ranges for integrating the cube. At blue = 3 km/s and red = 18 km/s, the two outflows are completely distinct. See entry for HOPS 370 for more detail."

Assuming SMZ 18 goes with SMZ 17, the source and CO counterpart (Outflow 13) to this flow is discussed in the entries under HOPS 370 and SMZ 17.

This flow is supposed by Stanke et al. 2010 to be responsible for shaping part of the cavity near V380 Ori (the so-called hole in the sky). Stanke et al. 2010 propose that SMZ 60 / HH 35 / MHO 113 has a counterflow SE of V380 Ori seen as the H2 knot SMZ 6-8 AKA MHO 118. This would represent a bipolar flor SE-NW driven by the V380 Ori system. Further extending this flow, Reipurth et al. 2013 argue that the HH 222 Orion Streamers region is a giant bow shock with proper motion away from the V380 Ori system. In the counterflow direction, to the SE, they newly identify HH 1041, a faint bow-shaped nebulosity. The total projected extend of this flow is then at least 5.3 pc, from HH 1041 in the SE, through the H2 knot SMZ 6-8 / MHO 118 just SE of V380 Ori, through SMZ 60 / HH 35 / MHO 113 just NW of V380 Ori, all the way to the Orion Streamer bow shock HH 222. This makes it one of the longest known outflows. They speculate that a dynamical interaction among the quadruple V380 Ori system triggered this outflow less than 28,000 years ago, based on the proper motion of HH 222. In CO, the redshifted cauliflower or hot-air-balloon shaped CO structure is here, surrounding V380 Ori. SMZ 60 is just at the NW edge of this redshifted structure.

Davis et al. 2009 argue instead that HH 33,40 are powered by a Spitzer source inside of the HH 40 nebulosity. This is where DFS 116 is located, as the putative source of this separate molecular flow.

DFS 123 marks the location of the brightest H2, the knotty bow shock on the E end of the flow. The source of this flow could be HOPS 355, a highly embedded class 0 protostar located near the middle of the flow. This seems like the only candidate. See HOPS355 figure and catalog entry for more info about this potential new CO outflow. There is both red and blue CO on both sides of the putative source in a broad EW filamentary structure."

Instead, Davis et al. assign this H2 flow to the young star < 1 arcminute to the NW, Spitzer Orion 747 (flat protostar class). In CO: There is a giant redshifted lobe of CO, part of which is well traced by these H2 knots, but the scale of the CO dwarfs the supposed scale of a small outflow from the nearby young star. There is some blueshifted CO to the NE as well. All of this high velocity emission is assigned to the new outflow 44 by Tanabe, but the red/blue morphology is very strange. Zooming out, the red CO structure appears connected to the HH 1/2 or V380 Ori regions to the north. Perhaps this is the counterflow to the cauliflower structure around V380 Ori? Or another outflow from HH 1/2? What the heck is going on here?"


Miscellaneous Notes
---------------------
Need to also check all Davis flows that are not driven by a HOPS source. (either the source is unidentified in Davis or it is identified but not in the HOPS catalog.

Spitzer Orion 747 drive H2 flow DFS 124, or this may be part of the large southern lobe of HH 1/2. THe large amount of blue/red CO in this area is assigned to the new Outflow 43 by Tanabe.

Tanabe outflow 18 (not listed above but described in HOPS 409 entry) is assigned to Spitzer Orion protostar 2236 (without H2)
Tanabe outflow 9 (not listed above) is driven not by a HOPS source, but a Spitzer Orion disk source with H2 jet from Davis.
Tanabe outflow 2 (not listed above) is driven not by a HOPS source, but a Spitzer Orion disk source with H2 jet from Davis.

Spitzer Orion 2368 - possible source of red lobe of Tanabe Outflow 7.
Spitzer Orion 2293 - possible source of a small red/blue outflow separate from the nearby Outflow 13 of tanabe, this could also be related to HOPS108. NEW CO outflow here!

V380 Ori (Spitzer Orion 796) may be source of red "cauliflower" emission attributed by Tanabe to Outflow 40/SMZ 63 - from HOPS 166 to the South.

V563 Ori seems to be the driving source of the CO 'fan' sticking out the north side of the very northern edge of the cloud into NGC1977. You can see a U-shaped dark feature in the VISTA NIR image.


hops93 and 94 seem to have small outflows (based on IR nebulosity) look for corresponding CO.
